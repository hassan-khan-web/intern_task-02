for reference and tools, I used Google, YouTube, ChatGPT, Deepseek, and Google Colab.
Google and YouTube helped me find tutorials and understand power BI. 
ChatGPT and Deepseek were used for understanding the Dataset and idea to get a format for deriving the charts and graphs and answers to interview questions. 
you can find the dataset in my repo. along with the pbix. file of the visualised dataset and the pdf file of the visualised dataset.
